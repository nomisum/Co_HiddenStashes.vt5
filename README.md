# Creating Cache Stories
There is an export script available for you to create stories with. In multiplayer it will only work if you are the host.

Go to the salt desert Almyra on Altis. Your player position is the center position of the cache. Use Zeus to place story objects around you. Once you are done, open the debug console and execute `[] execVM "exportStory.sqf"`. Now go to the `cacheStories` folder, create a new file and name it after your story (e.g. `myCoolStory.sqf`). Paste your clipboard into that file and save. Open `cfgCacheStories.hpp` and create a new story that uses your newly created script. For example:

```sqf
class myCoolStory {
    size = 20;
    onRoad = 0;
    onCoast = 0;
    script = "cacheStories\myCoolStory.sqf";
};
```

Now add that story to any cache in `cfgCaches.hpp` that you want to use it for. For example:

```sqf
class myCoolCache {
    //OTHER ATTRIBUTES OMITTED

    cacheStories[] = {
        "someOtherStory",
        "yetAnotherStory",
        "myCoolStory"
    };
};
```
